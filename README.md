# mnet - Modular neural NETwork library
mnet (**m**odular neural **net**work library) enables stress-free PyTorch coding with well-structured modules.  
mnet divides complex neural network codes into common tiny building blocks (modules) and offer them as extendable library.  
With mnet, users can generate neural network with PyTorch but the stress from code complexity must be reduced!!
